# SalesAnalysis
A sales analysis report shows the trends that occur in a company's sales volume over time. In its most basic form, a sales analysis report shows whether sales are increasing or declining. At any time during the fiscal year, sales managers may analyze the trends in the report to determine the best course of action.
